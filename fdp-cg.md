# W3C FAIR Data Point CG Charter

## Mission

The [FAIR Data Point project](https://www.fairdatapoint.org/) is the realisation of the vision of a group of authors of the original paper on FAIR on how (meta)data could be presented on the web using existing standards. FAIR Data Point (FDP) is a metadata service that provides access to metadata following the FAIR principles [FAIR-principles]. FDP uses a REST API for creating, storing and serving FAIR metadata. FDP is a software that, from one side, allows digital objects owners/publishers to expose the metadata of their digital objects in a FAIR manner and, for another side, allows digital objects' consumers to discover information (metadata) about offered digital objects. Commonly, the FAIR Data Point is used to expose metadata of datasets but metadata of other types of digital objects can also be exposed such as ontologies, repositories, analysis algorithms, websites, etc.

The mission of the W3C FAIR Data Point CG (W3C FDP CG) is to explore and define the specifications for how applications could behave as a FAIR Data Point.

The group will aim to provide developers of new or existing applications technical specifications to deliver on the promise of interoperability based on open standards.
## Scope of work

This community group will:

- Plan and write a new version of the FDP specifications.
- Work with specification authors, FDP users and developers to define best practices for web developer documentation, code examples, and information architecture.
- Improve the FDP reference implementation based on new requirements and specifications.
- Coordinate documentation efforts: Collaborate with other W3C community groups, such as TODO:Complete


## Key deliverables

- Write and maintain the [FDP specifications](https://github.com/fdp-specs/fdp-specs.github.io).
- Improve and maintain the [FDP Reference Implementation](https://github.com/FAIRDataTeam/FAIRDataPoint).

## Out of scope

The group may produce Community Group Reports within the scope of this charter but not Specifications.
